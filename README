Naiad Buddy for Houdini toolkit
-------------------------------

Version: v0.2b

The project home can be found at: http://code.google.com/p/geo2emp/

The source has been tested with:
Gentoo 64bit, GCC 4.3.3
Ubuntu 9.04 64bit, GCC 4.1.3
Houdini 10.0.465 (www.sidefx.com)
Naiad 0.93b (www.exoticmatter.com)

This library is not backwards compatible with Naiad. It *may* work with, or compile against, previous versions but it has not been tested/implemented.

Description:
------------
This tool converts Houdini's .bgeo files to Naiad's .emp files. This tool was built in order to import/export .EMP files directly from Houdini.

Current Features:
-----------------
 * Writes triangulated geometry and point velocities to EMP files.
 * Loads particles and particle velocities from EMP files.
 * Loads meshes from EMP files.

Components:
-----------
 * Geo2Emp class for converting between Naiad's .emp and Houdini's .bgeo format
 * geo2emp commandline tool to server as frontend to the converter class


Directories:
------------
src/ - Source code for bgeo2emp converter tool
bin/ - Script and binary used to to run bgeo2emp tool
hip/ - Sample .hip file for Houdini to illustrate export process
houdini/ - Files that need to be placed in the Houdini path
sample_hip/ - Sample Houdini files to show how to use geo2emp


Command Line Usage:
-------------------
Convert BGEO to EMP:
	geo2emp source.bgeo dest.emp

Convert EMP to BGEO:
	geo2emp source.emp dest.bgeo

For more help:
	geo2emp -h 


Recommended usage of the commandline tool: 
------------------------------------------
It is recommended to integrate the commandline tool into Houdini using Houdini's GEOio mechanism so that you can read and write .emp files from within Houdini (see Installing section). 

Performance tip:
----------------
Please take note that it is indeed slower to load .emp files through a File SOP than their .bgeo equivalent since it has to convert all the .emp data on each frame. Rather convert your .emp sequences to a .bgeo sequence and load the .bgeo files to allow for faster loading & scrubbing.

Compiling (Linux):
------------------
1. source houdini_setup
2. Make sure your NAIAD_PATH has been set up, and the $NAIAD_PATH/lib directory is in the linker path (either through ld.so.conf or LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
3. type "make" 

If the compile was successful, a binary file (geo2emp) will be output in the bin/ directory.

Installing (Linux):
-------------------
2. Copy the "geo2emp" binary to a directory in your path variable, e.g., /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
3. Copy the houdini/GEOio script to a directory in your HOUDINI_PATH or append the contents to an existing GEOio file.

The "geo2emp" tool should now be ready to run. Make sure your Houdini and Naiad environment is properly set up, then type "geo2emp" in the console. If the installation was successful, this should print the usage instructions for the tool.
