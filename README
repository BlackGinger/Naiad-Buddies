Open source BGEO/EMP converter tool for Houdini 10
--------------------------------------------------

This library has been tested with:
Gentoo 64bit, GCC 4.3.3
Houdini 10.0.401 (www.sidefx.com)
Naiad alpha.20.4 (www.exoticmatter.com)

NOTE: This file is currently outdated. It needs to be updated for the new bgeo2emp converter...after we have a decent code base.


Description:
------------
This tool converts Houdini's .bgeo files to Naiad's .emp files. This tool was built in order to import/export .EMP files directly from Houdini.


Current Features:
-----------------
* Writes already triangulated geometry and point velocities to EMP files.
* Extracts points and point velocities from EMP files.
* Extracts meshes from EMP files.


Directories:
------------
src/ - Source code for bgeo2emp converter tool
bin/ - Script and binary used to to run bgeo2emp tool
hip/ - Sample .hip file for Houdini to illustrate export process
houdini/ - Files that need to be placed in the Houdini path
sample_hip/ - Sample Houdini files to show how to use geo2emp


Command Line Usage:
-------------------
Convert to EMP:
geo2emp source.bgeo dest.emp

Convert from EMP:
geo2emp source.emp dest.bgeo


.EMP as internal Houdini format:
--------------------------------
Houdini has the nifty ability to load/save file formats as if the file formats were native, using commandline converters. bgeo2emp will use this feature to import and export .EMP files. See "Installing" section on how to achieve this.


Compiling (Linux):
------------------
1. source the houdini_setup file so the makefile has access to the "hcustom" build script
2. Go into the src directory and edit the Makefile. Adjust the NAIAD variable to point to your Naiad install path.
3. From within the src/ directory, run "make":
   bgeo2emp/src$ make
	 
If the compile was successful, a new binary file (bgeo2emp.bin) will be present in the bin/ directory.


Installing (Linux):
-------------------
1. Edit the "bin/geo2emp" script and adjust the Naiad path to point to your installation.
2. Copy the "geo2emp" script and "bgeo2emp.bin" binary to a directory in your path variable, e.g., /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
3. Copy the houdini/GEOio script to a directory in your HOUDINI_PATH or append the contents to an existing GEOio file.

The "geo2emp" tool should now be ready to run. Make sure your Houdini environment has been sourced, and type "geo2emp" in the console. If the installation was successful, this should print the usage instructions for the tool.


Troubleshooting (Linux):
------------------------
1) libstdc++ issues:
Something to take note of is that Naiad has its own libstdc++.so.6 library but is not necessarily incompatible with Houdini 10 which results in messages like this: bgeo2emp.bin: /usr/local/naiad/alpha.20.4/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.9' not found (required by /usr/local/houdini/10.0.401/dsolib/libHoudiniUI.so)
To combat this problem, the geo2emp script puts the path of the system-wide libstdc++ first in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
