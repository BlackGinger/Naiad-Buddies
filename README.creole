= Introduction

The Naiad Buddy for Houdini facilitates data translation between the Naiad and Houdini 3D graphics software packages.

The Naiad Buddy for Houdini comprises two workflows, which can be used separately or together:

* Houdini .bgeo files may be translated into Naiad EMP files (and vice versa) using the {{{geo2emp}}} command-line tools.
* Houdini .bgeo files may be natively read and written inside Naiad itself, using the Naiad file operators {{{Bgeo-Read}}} and {{{Bgeo-Write}}}.

== The Command-Line Tools

The Command-Line Tools convert Houdini's .bgeo files to Naiad's .emp files. 

This library is *not* backwards compatible with Naiad. It *may* work with, or compile against, previous versions but proper functionality is not guaranteed.

=== Current Features

* Writes triangulated geometry and point velocities to EMP files.
* Loads particles and particle velocities from EMP files.
* Loads multiple meshes from EMP files.
* Allow setting timestep value for EMP files (needed for EMP sequences)
* Allow explicitly setting body name for writing data to EMP files

=== Command Line Usage:
Convert BGEO to EMP:
{{{
geo2emp source.bgeo dest.emp
}}}

Convert EMP to BGEO:
{{{
geo2emp source.emp dest.bgeo
}}}

Command-Line Help:
{{{
geo2emp -h 
}}}

Recommended usage of the commandline tool: 
------------------------------------------
It is recommended to integrate the commandline tool into Houdini using Houdini's GEOio mechanism so that you can read and write .emp files from within Houdini (see Installing section). 

Performance tip:
----------------
Please take note that it is indeed slower to load .emp files through a File SOP than their .bgeo equivalent since it has to convert all the .emp data on each frame. Rather convert your .emp sequences to a .bgeo sequence and load the .bgeo files to allow for faster loading & scrubbing.

=== Components

* Geo2Emp class for converting between Naiad's .emp and Houdini's .bgeo format
* geo2emp commandline tool to server as frontend to the converter class

=== Directory Structure

cmd/src/ - Source code for bgeo2emp converter tool
cmd/bin/ - Script and binary used to to run bgeo2emp tool
cmd/hip/ - Sample .hip file for Houdini to illustrate export process
cmd/houdini/ - Files that need to be placed in the Houdini path
cmd/sample_hip/ - Sample Houdini files to show how to use geo2emp

=== The source has been tested with:

* Gentoo 64bit, GCC 4.4.4
* Houdini 11.0.458 (www.sidefx.com)
* Naiad 0.5.0 (www.exoticmatter.com)

=== Compiling (Linux):
1. source houdini_setup
2. Make sure your NAIAD_PATH has been set up, and the $NAIAD_PATH/lib directory is in the linker path (either through ld.so.conf or LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
3. type "make" 

If the compile was successful, a binary file (geo2emp) will be output in the bin/ directory.

=== Installing (Linux):
2. Copy the "geo2emp" binary to a directory in your path variable, e.g., /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
3. Copy the houdini/GEOio script to a directory in your HOUDINI_PATH or append the contents to an existing GEOio file.

The "geo2emp" tool should now be ready to run. Make sure your Houdini and Naiad environment is properly set up, then type "geo2emp" in the console. If the installation was successful, this should print the usage instructions for the tool.

Changes:
--------
0.2b)

0.1)
	- First release.

The User Operators are Naiad file operators (called Bgeo-Read and Bgeo-Write).  These file operators allows native BGEO reading and writing from within Naiad itself, eliminating the command-line BGEO-to-EMP conversion step that is otherwise required.

= 1.0 Installing the Build Tools And Configuring Your Environment

You only need to follow the instructions in this section 1.0 once (the first time you want to use the Naiad Buddy for Houdini).  **However, please follow the instructions in section 2.0 every time you need to update the Naiad Buddy for Houdini due to a new Naiad (or Houdini) release.**

Since you will be compiling and building this Naiad Buddy yourself, you will need the following tools and utilities installed:

* a C++ compiler such as gcc/g++
* cmake
* git

These are very common tools you can find on any flavor of Linux.

Unfortunately, each Linux distribution handles the exact method of installation slightly differently.  We will show how to install these using Ubuntu:

{{{
sudo apt-get install git-core gcc g++ cmake -y
}}}

(for installing these common build tools on other Linux distros, please consult Google).

Next, you have to set up the environment for the plugin manually by editing the appropriate shell resource configuration file.

The first step is to determine which shell you are using; there are two main types: bash and tcsh/csh. 

To determine which shell you're using, please type

{{{
$ echo $SHELL
}}}

if you see /bin/bash - then you are using a bash shell.  Otherwise it's tcsh/csh.

== 1.1 Bash Configuration

Please edit the .bashrc configuration file to add the necessary environment variables.  The .bashrc configuration file is a text file which is located in your home directory.  You can use any text editor (such as gedit) to edit the .bashrc file:

{{{
$ gedit ~/.bashrc
}}}

Once inside the .bashrc file, please skip to the very end, and add the following lines:

{{{
export EM_COMPILER=gcc
export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++
export EM_PLAT=LINUX
export EM_ARCH=`uname -m`
}}}

== 1.2 tcsh/csh Configuration

If you are NOT using a bash shell, you need to edit the .cshrc configuration file, which is located in your home directory.  You can use any text editor (such as gedit) to edit the .cshrc file:

{{{
$ gedit ~/.cshrc
}}}

Once inside the .cshrc file, please skip to the very end, and add the following lines:

{{{
setenv EM_COMPILER gcc
setenv CC gcc
setenv CXX g++
setenv EM_PLAT LINUX
setenv EM_ARCH `uname -m`
}}}

== 1.3 Verifying Your Configuration

Quit the text editor and close the shell. Open a new shell, which should take into account the new variables you've added.  You should verify this by typing:

{{{
$ echo $NAIAD_PATH
}}}

This should print the path to your current Naiad installation.  If it does not, then you've made a mistake.



= 2.0 Compiling Naiad Buddy for Houdini

You need to do this every time a new version of Naiad is released that contains API changes.  This is typically semi-major or major releases, such as 1.0 to 1.5 or 2.0, etc.  It may also be necessary between Houdini releases.

We assume the following:

* Naiad and Houdini have been installed.  
* The environment variable {{{$NAIAD_PATH}}} points to the location of the Naiad installation.
* You want to keep the buddy source in your home directory, e.g., in the path ~/naiad-buddy-houdini.git.  If you wish to use another location for the source code, then please make the appropriate substitutions in the commands shown below:

First, get a fresh copy of the latest Naiad Buddy for Houdini source code:

{{{
rm -rf ~/naiad-buddy-houdini.git
git clone git://github.com/ExoticMatter/Naiad-Buddy-For-Houdini.git ~/naiad-buddy-houdini.git
}}}

Now, to compile this buddy, run the following commands:

{{{
cd ~/naiad-buddy-houdini.git
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$NAIAD_PATH ~/naiad-buddy-houdini.git
make
cd .. 
rm -rf build
}}}
